# Rankup

Ore link: https://ore.spongepowered.org/Asherslab/Rankup

-- API7 version released YAY!

Rankup is a plugin brought to you by the Minecolonies team. It's goal is to make an as simple as possible auto-Ranking plugin for any permissions plugin (as long as they use the SpongeAPI correctly that is). Many thanks to Rankupper for code inspiration, and the Nucleus team for QSML (Modules) inspiration!
